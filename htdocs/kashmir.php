                        that one feels it is the ultimate homage you could pay to it. But somehow, there is a vagueness
                        in it which does not do justice to this part of the country.
                        What is paradise in Jammu & Kashmir? It is its alpine meadows, crystal clear lakes, amber hues
                        of the trees during autumn, boathouses, gondolas, apple orchards and everything else that is a
                        part of its landscape.

                        Bahu Fort
                        The ancient Bahu Fort in Jammu is believed to be originally built by Raja Bahu Lochan about
                        3,000 years ago. It was refurbished by the Dogra rulers in the 19th century. The fort is a
                        religious place and within its precincts is a temple dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kali, the
                        presiding deity of Jammu. The temple is known locally as the “Bawey Wali Mata temple”. Just
                        beneath the fort is the terraced Bagh-e-Bahu Garden laid in the style of Mughal gardens which
                        affords panoramic view of the Jammu city and underground fish aquarium.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Akhnoor Fort
                        The Fort was built during the early 19th century and commands a towering view along the right
                        bank of the Chenab. The present fort was probably started in 1762 AD at the behest of Raja Tegh
                        Singh, as an autonomous principle state. A devastating famine is said to have broken in the
                        country during this time. In order to provide work to his famishing people Raj Tegh Singh
                        started the construction of Akhnoor Fort and Palace on banks of the Chenab River. He supplied
                        food to the workers for 2 years and thus saved the principality His son Alam Singh completed the
                        Akhnoor fort in 1802. On the eastern side, there are steps leading down to the River Chenab.
                        Though constructed in the 18th century, most of the steps are in a good state of preservation.
                        The ghat served as the important spot for performance of religious sites by the people of the
                        region. The turrets or Burj are still intact is called the Kishore Singh Burj after Maharaja
                        Gulab Singh’s father who was a close associate of Guru Gobind Singh the 10th Sikh Guru. There
                        are traces of paintings on the walls of the rooms of the fort.

                    </h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Ambaran
                        Ambaran ,also locally known as Pambaran, is a village of Akhnoor tehsil in Jammu district and is
                        said to have been founded by Amba Jagdev Pawar . A scion of Pawar dynasty of Dhar Ujjain which
                        seems to have been the original capital of Akhnoor. It was named Ambari after the family diety
                        Amba, one of the names of goddess Durga. The name got changed gradually into Ambaran. Ambaran is
                        the eighth place in the world, where relics of Buddha have been found in a stupa. Historians are
                        of the opinion that the place might have been an important centre of Buddhism between the 1st
                        and 7th century B.C. A cultural sequence of four historical periods has already been unraveled
                        at Ambaran. It is believed to be the only early Buddhist site in Jammu region. Excavations have
                        unearthed terracotta figures, small sculptures, pottery and brunt brick structures dating back
                        to pre Kushan and post Gupta period.
