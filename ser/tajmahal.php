                    <p class="paragraph">The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast
                        Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was
                        built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting
                        in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on
                        the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653
                        AD. The existence of several historical and Quaranic inscriptions in Arabic script have
                        facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal. For its construction, masons, stone-cutters,
                        inlayers, carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome builders and other artisans were requisitioned
                        from the whole of the empire and also from the Central Asia and Iran. Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the
                        main architect of the Taj Mahal.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-12">


                    <p class="paragraph">The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural
                        achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its recognised architectonic beauty
                        has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave and convex and light shadow; such as
                        arches and domes further increases the aesthetic aspect. The colour combination of lush green
                        scape reddish pathway and blue sky over it show cases the monument in ever changing tints and
                        moods. The relief work in marble and inlay with precious and semi precious stones make it a
                        monument apart. </p>

                    <p class="paragraph">The uniqueness of Taj Mahal lies in some truly remarkable innovations
                        carried out by the horticulture planners and architects of Shah Jahan. One such genius planning
                        is the placing of tomb at one end of the quadripartite garden rather than in the exact centre,
                        which added rich depth and perspective to the distant view of the monument. It is also, one of
                        the best examples of raised tomb variety. The tomb is further raised on a square platform with
                        the four sides of the octagonal base of the minarets extended beyond the square at the corners.
                        The top of the platform is reached through a lateral flight of steps provided in the centre of
                        the southern side. The ground plan of the Taj Mahal is in perfect balance of composition, the
                        octagonal tomb chamber in the centre, encompassed by the portal halls and the four corner rooms.
                        The plan is repeated on the upper floor. The exterior of the tomb is square in plan, with
                        chamfered corners. The large double storied domed chamber, which houses the cenotaphs of Mumtaz
                        Mahal and Shah Jahan, is a perfect octagon in plan. The exquisite octagonal marble lattice
                        screen encircling both cenotaphs is a piece of superb workmanship. It is highly polished and
                        richly decorated with inlay work. The borders of the frames are inlaid with precious stones
                        representing flowers executed with wonderful perfection. The hues and the shades of the stones
                        used to make the leaves and the flowers appear almost real. The cenotaph of Mumtaz Mahal is in
                        perfect centre of the tomb chamber, placed on a rectangular platform decorated with inlaid
                        flower plant motifs. The cenotaph of Shah Jahan is greater than Mumtaz Mahal and installed more
                        than thirty years later by the side of the latter on its west. The upper cenotaphs are only
                        illusory and the real graves are in the lower tomb chamber (crypt), a practice adopted in the
                        imperial Mughal tombs.
                    </p>

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The four free-standing minarets at the corners of the platform added a hitherto unknown
                        dimension to the Mughal architecture. The four minarets provide not only a kind of spatial
                        reference to the monument but also give a three dimensional effect to the edifice.
                    </p>

                    <p class="paragraph">

                        The most impressive in the Taj Mahal complex next to the tomb, is the main gate which stands
                        majestically in the centre of the southern wall of the forecourt. The gate is flanked on the
                        north front by double arcade galleries. The garden in front of the galleries is subdivided into
                        four quarters by two main walk-ways and each quarters in turn subdivided by the narrower
                        cross-axial walkways, on the Timurid-Persian scheme of the walled in garden. The enclosure walls
                        on the east and west have a pavilion at the centre.
                    </p>

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The Taj Mahal is a perfect symmetrical planned building, with an emphasis of bilateral symmetry
                        along a central axis on which the main features are placed. The building material used is
                        brick-in-lime mortar veneered with red sandstone and marble and inlay work of precious/semi
                        precious stones. The mosque and the guest house in the Taj Mahal complex are built of red
                        sandstone in contrast to the marble tomb in the centre. Both the buildings have a large platform
                        over the terrace at their front. Both the mosque and the guest house are the identical
                        structures. They have an oblong massive prayer hall consist of three vaulted bays arranged in a
                        row with central dominant portal. The frame of the portal arches and the spandrels are veneered
                        in white marble. The spandrels are filled with flowery arabesques of stone intarsia and the
                        arches bordered with rope molding.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Taj Mahal represents the finest architectural and artistic achievement through perfect harmony
                        and excellent craftsmanship in a whole range of Indo-Islamic sepulchral architecture. It is a
                        masterpiece of architectural style in conception, treatment and execution and has unique
                        aesthetic qualities in balance, symmetry and harmonious blending of various elements.

                        Integrity is maintained in the intactness of tomb, mosque, guest house, main gate and the whole
                        Taj Mahal complex. The physical fabric is in good condition and structural stability, nature of
                        foundation, verticality of the minarets and other constructional aspects of Taj Mahal have been
                        studied and continue to be monitored. To control the impact of deterioration due for atmospheric
                        pollutants, an air control monitoring station is installed to constantly monitor air quality and
                        control decay factors as they arise. To ensure the protection of the setting, the adequate
                        management and enforcement of regulations in the extended buffer zone is needed. In addition,
                        future development for tourist facilities will need to ensure that the functional and visual
                        integrity of the property is maintained, particularly in the relationship with the Agra Fort.

                        and conservation works have been carried out right from the British period in India these have
                        not compromised to the original qualities of the buildings. Future conservation work will need
                        to follow guidelines that ensure that qualities such as form and design continue to be
                        preserved.</p>

                    </h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">




                        The management of Taj Mahal complex is carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India and the
                        legal protection of the monument and the control over the regulated area around the monument is
                        through the various legislative and regulatory frameworks that have been established, including
                        the Ancient Monument and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act 1958 and Rules 1959 Ancient
                        Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation); which is adequate to
                        the overall administration of the property and buffer areas. Additional supplementary laws
                        ensure the protection of the property in terms of development in the surroundings.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">

                        An area of 10,400 sq km around the Taj Mahal is defined to protect the monument from pollution.
                        The Supreme Court of India in December, 1996, delivered a ruling banning use of coal/coke in
                        industries located in the Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) and switching over to natural gas or
                        relocating them outside the TTZ. The TTZ comprises of 40 protected monuments including three
                        World Heritage Sites - Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">

                        The fund provided by the federal government is adequate for the buffer areas. The fund provided
                        by the federal government is adequate for the overall conservation, preservation and maintenance
                        of the complex to supervise activities at the site under the guidance of the Superintending
                        Archaeologist of the Agra Circle. The implementation of an Integrated Management plan is
                        necessary to ensure that the property maintains the existing conditions, particularly in the
                        light of significant pressures derived from visitation that will need to be adequately managed.
                        The Management plan should also prescribe adequate guidelines for proposed infrastructure
                        development and establish a comprehensive Public Use plan.
